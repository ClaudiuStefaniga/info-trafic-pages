# Info Traffic


An application with and about traffic participants. Through the application you can inform the other participants about accidents, blockages, bumps or any traffic danger. Moreover, communicate with them through messages based on the registration number.


# How it works?


After downloading the application, you must register using an e-mail address and a registration number. Based on the registration number, your account will be identified and you will receive messages and notifications from other traffic participants.

Add a short description, the registration number of the car involved in the incident / accident (so that you can be informed immediately about what happened), an image and the location.
